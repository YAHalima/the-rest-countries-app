The Rest Countries app is a comprehensive application that encompasses around 250 countries spanning across six continents: Oceania, Africa, Europe, Antarctica, America, and Asia.

On the homepage, there is a header with a Dark Mode button, allowing users to toggle between light mode and dark mode for their preferred viewing experience. Below the header, there are two buttons: a search field and a filter field.

The search field enables users to easily search for specific country names, facilitating quick access to desired information. On the other hand, the filter field allows users to search for countries based on their respective regions, namely the continents.

All countries are prominently displayed on the homepage, accompanied by their corresponding names, flags, and brief descriptions. By clicking on a country's name, users are directed to a more detailed page offering in-depth information about that particular country.

Furthermore, the detailed page also provides information about the country's bordering nations. Clicking on a border country's name leads users to its respective detailed page, providing a seamless navigation experience.

To facilitate easy navigation, the detailed page includes a "Back" button that allows users to return to the homepage with a single click, ensuring effortless exploration of the app's extensive country database.
